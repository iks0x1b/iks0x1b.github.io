## Step one is acknowledging you can write more consumable code.
## Step two is prioritizing writing code for humans, not computers.
## Step three is ensuring your code is consistently written in this way.

As a developer the reality in 2022 is that no one is doing anything new in most modern languages.
Assuming this to be true what can one even do to improve the work you output?

### Complexity

Oh right, thats what developers are hired to solve you could say, in reality is that complexity is just a metric that an be applied to the developers output.
Arguably this metric could be applied to other portions of a given IT organization, and even ones individual life.

As a developer...
You could simply say that you will write component foo in the simplest way possible, but that is an oversimplification of the problem.
You need to actively think about the complexity you are creating and explicitly takes steps to reduce it.
In an effort to understand what is meant here you could run an enum...

| Complexity | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Algorithmic | How much resources does your codebase consume at runtime, this is also sometimes referred to as time complexity. |
| Cyclomatic | How many possible outcomes does your codebase produce, how many branching paths are there before output is produced? |
| Cognitive | How difficult is your codebase to understand, did you use sorted() or write an entire new module to run a radix sort because you felt like it? |

Chances are you are writing in a modern language with a solid set of best practices. 
I urge you to look these up and stick to them, possibly even introduce some of the common tools such as black(code style formatter for python) and pylint(linter and formatter for python) into your workflow.
Be sure to review known antipatterns before calling your problems solved.

After this base layer is accounted for you can try to reduce the complexity types I listed above.
I am not sure what I was trying to achieve with this additional post but I felt strongly enough to write.

Hope you are having a wonderful day!
